While researching costs, I realized that things such as the spur gears would be pricy. Because many of these parts would be cheaper made rather than bought, it is challenging to give an accurate price range for this product. However, the target cost is ~$100 per LifePump. - Estimated cost of mass-produced product (100): $100 per unit

When doing some research, I found something called the Aquaduct. Essentially when you put water in the back and pedal, it filters the water. It also has a stationary mode. Although these ideas may seem rather similar, the LifePump is unique in 3 areas: a) The Aquaduct requires storage areas: one for the dirty water and one for the clean water. The LifePump only requires one container, as it pumps water directly from the source, acting as a "tap" of sorts. b) It is more cost-effective, as it doesn't require a custom-built hull, like the Aquaduct has. c) The LifePump is better suited for entire communities.
- The LifePump is a bicycle repurposed for filtering unsafe water by pumping it through a positive displacement pump -
- It takes water from almost anywhere (e.g. wells, lakes and even rivers), and filters it into safe water usable for cooking, drinking and cleaning!

- It uses something called a rotary lobe pump, and I chose this pump for two reasons: a) Positive displacement allows water to be pushed from one place to another, especially up. This is very useful in the case of wells. b) It also has great properties that are applicable to the LifePump. For example, it has a long lifespan, requires low maintenance, it is self-priming, can run dry and it has low pulsing (meaning the water would be more even in its flow and run smoother)!

- LifeStraw can filter at around 0.5L/min. - LifePump can pump at around 1L/min, so as the pump wears down, it will still pump effectivley. - Pump uses a barbed brass hose fitting to secure the suction hose. - Uses PVC suction hose, ID of 1", OD of 1.26" - Has 25' of suction hose. - Lobe pump rotors have pitch diameter of 2" - Needs around 15 PSI to function - Spur gears have 2" pitch diameter - Gear ratio for front sprocket:back sprocket is 2:1 - Model uses #40 roller chain, single strand, riveted.

This idea dates back to March, 2021. In grade 6, a friend (Vania Qiu) and I participated in a STEM challenge in which the theme was improving the world We knew immediately that we wanted to aid those less fortunate than ourselves, so after a bit of thought, we decided to find a way to give access to clean water to people in developing countries. Due to the fact i was in grade 6, my CAD models were quite simple. The original design of the LifePump was rudimentary. The idea was still there, but as you can see in the image to the right, the design was slightly different, and could use much refining.

I found there were quite a few troubles while modelling the LifePump, especially the second time around. For example, my greatest challenge while modelling the LifePump was probably modelling the pump itself. I had a really hard time trying to look though engineers' drawings and such things. Even after I figured out the rotors there was still the issue of how it would connect to the tubing and the LifeStraw, etc. After figuring out a lot of math involving the pump, Everything was ready to go! For more information on procedures/difficulties, please don't hesitate to ask!

- Due to the fact that the LifeStraw can filter up to 1000G (4000L) of water, it can support around 1333 peoples' suggested water intake! - Shown in the graph below, 80.7% of Eritrea has no access to water! Out of 3,678,158 people, only 709,884 get water. - A beginner cyclist typically pedals at a rate of 60-85 rpm. - The LifePump can handle around 5.6 days of constant filtering.
